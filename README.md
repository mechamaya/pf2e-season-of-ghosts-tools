# pf2e-season-of-ghosts-tools
Tools for the Season of Ghosts adventure path for Pathfinder 2nd Edition.

### Module Contents
- Merchant actors, recommend using [Item Piles](https://github.com/fantasycalendar/FoundryVTT-ItemPiles) module for merchant interface, but they should still work without this using the default loot actor interface.
- Merchant service items, for use with Item Piles merchant services. 
- Roll Tables for random encounters in chapters 1 and 3.
- Macros (These all only show results to GM):
   - Chapter 1 Random Encounter Flat Check macro. Checks the party's active exploration activities and adjusts the DC of this flat check accordingly. Draws from the appropriate roll table automatically if check is a success
   - Chapter 1 Blood Rain macro, simple flat check that posts description
   - Chapter 3 Random Encounter Flat Check macro. Links to two different roll table macros for if the party is close or far from town.
